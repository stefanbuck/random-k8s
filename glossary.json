    "description": "Each Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some state change in the system. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time. Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued existence of events with that reason. Events should be treated as informative, best-effort, supplemental data. In Kubernetes, auditing generates a different kind of Event record (API group audit.k8s.io).",
